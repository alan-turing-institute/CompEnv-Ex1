# Computational Environment Example 1

## Orienting you to the GitHub repository

In this GitHub repository there is one branch (`master`), a script `test_script.py` and an `environment.yml` file.

You can see them all at https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex1

## Instructions

1. Click the link below to open a Binder for the `master` branch.
  It will take you to a Jupyter Lab environment.
  We recommend you right click and select "Open Link in a New Tab" in order to keep these instructions visible.

* :point_right: Binder for `master`: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex1/master?urlpath=lab

JupyterLab is an IDE (integrated development environment) providing access to features such as:
* Jupyter Notebooks
* IPython Consoles
* a terminal
* a text editor

2. At the bottom of the screen, click the "Terminal" button (under "Other").

3. In the terminal which opens, run the command `python test_script.py` and examine the output.

   You can examine the code in `test_script.py` by double clicking on it in the panel on the left.

4. In the same terminal, now run `source activate kernel` then re-run `python test_script.py` and examine the output.

5. If you want to get the same output as from step 3, run `source deactivate` and then repeat step 3.

## Questions

* What's different between these two outputs?
* What is happening to cause this difference?
* How do these differences arise?
